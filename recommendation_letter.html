            <h5>What is a Letter of Recommendation (LOR)?</h5>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">A recommendation letter is a document that provides the Admission Committee
                with a comprehensive insight into your suitable candidature for admission into the concerned University.
                The letter aims at enabling the Admission Committee to gain a clearer and favourable picture of your
                experience, achievements, contributions and skills communicated by the recommender through the
                recommendation letter.

                Provided that almost every application necessitates submission of 2-3 recommendation letters, you must
                have your recommenders identified and agreed to prepare your letter well in time. Also, don’t underrate
                the importance of a LOR as it is almost as important as your Statement of Purpose, Resume or any other
                document for that matter. While choosing the right recommender, you must remember a few key pointers
                following which you will end up submitting outstanding LOR’s to the Admission Committee.</p>
            <h5>Types of LOR.</h5>
            <p>Letter of Recommendations broadly can be classified into two broad categories based on the Nature of the
                Recommender.

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Academic LOR.</li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Academic Letter of Recommendation (LOR) provided by a faculty member
                    of your previous institute. Usually, universities ask for you to provide two or three LORs from your
                    previous institute (this could be your teachers from your schools in case of undergraduate courses
                    and professors from your college/University in case you are applying for masters' programs). The
                    Letter of Recommendation from faculty often varies in the content and requires the professor to
                    highlight the applicant’s accomplishments as a student of the course.</p>
                <li>Professional LOR</li>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the universities have a pre-defined work experience requirements
                    for MBA admission. Accordingly, they request a Professional Letter of Recommendation from an
                    immediate supervisor. The Professional Letter of Recommendation from a supervisor varies from an
                    Academic LOR in terms of some specific content that focuses on the applicant’s ability to work
                    within a team, the exposure to the domain, as well as his/her leadership abilities-All necessary to
                    MBA course, applied for. </p>
            </ol>
            <h5>How to write a Letter of Recommendation (LOR)</h5>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Unless and otherwise specified, a letter of recommendation is a 400-500 word
                essay which talks about the candidate's strengths and weaknesses. There are some things you must include
                in a Letter of Recommendation like the nature of association as well as the tenure of association. Apart
                from that, there are some basic formats which must also be kept in mind. Most of the universities
                require this letter to be on the official letterhead. For an Academic LOR - the university's letterhead
                is required and for a Professional LOR - the letterhead of the company. What is important to remember in
                the latter case is that the letterhead should be of the company the recommender is working in. This
                usually creates a problem if your recommender has moved on to another organization. Hence, the student
                must know how to choose the right recommender.<br><br>

                An important point to be kept in mind is that a LOR is not a repetition of an SOP. An ideal LOR is
                supposed to demonstrate aspects/perspectives of your personality not mentioned either in your SOP or
                resume. Thus, an ideal recommender is the one who knows you well, has personally witnessed the quality
                of work delivered by you and readily agreed to provide specific instances of your valued contribution
                and excellence. A generic LOR is a strict no-no as it does not offer much value to your candidature for
                the program you are applying to.<br><br>

                You must always remember that the Admission Committee scurries through thousands of applications and
                yours is one of them. Now, in order to stand out, focus on including your qualities and accomplishments
                reinforced by real instances. Another important point here is to endeavour to make all your LORs unique
                and that can be achieved only if you include unique instances in all the LORs. Making an Impressive
                Letter of Recommendation is as important as writing a winning SOP.</p>

            <h5>Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Format from Faculty. </h5>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                LORs or Letter of Recommendations is usually either in question and answer format. While the question
                and answer format may vary from university to university, the running formats are standardized. They are
                usually about 400-500 words and divided into 4 equal paragraphs. Though both Academic and Professional
                LOR may vary in content, the structure/ format is also differentiable. <br><br>

                For Academic LORs, in the first paragraph, provide the following details (of the recommender) -
                designation, department and college name affiliated to university name. Also, write the capacity in
                which the recommender has been associated to you along with the number of years/duration of your
                association with him/her. In addition, mention the subjects the recommender taught you along with the
                semesters. In the case of the project guide, write the name of the project undertaken under his guidance
                and the semester when it was undertaken. <br><br>

                In the second paragraph, please mention your project, seminar, workshop, internship, etc. (their names
                along with your contribution to them) this recommender would like to talk about. Ask the recommender to
                explicitly mention what about these impressed him/her. If the recommender is your project guide, he must
                write about the project he guided you on and what about your role in the project he finds worth
                mentioning and why. <br><br>

                In the third paragraph, quote 1-2 instances from the classroom where your
                participation/contribution/involvement impressed this faculty. You may provide examples of classroom
                discussions or any query raised by you which ended up clearing others’ doubts as well. You may also
                provide an instance from the classroom where you provided an out-of-the-box solution to a problem that
                worked in favour of your team/class. You may provide details of just about any activity pertaining to
                academics you participated in that the recommender wishes to share with the Admission Committee. The
                recommender may also talk about your entrepreneurship skills and your aptitude for it. <br><br>

                In the fourth paragraph, the recommender must mention your extra-curricular/co-curricular activities and
                achievements. Usually, you must end your LOR with the Name, Designation, Department, College, City,
                University, City, Contact and Email details of your recommender.
